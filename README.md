- **Advanced Events** - Complex event handling patterns

## 🛠️ How to Use This Project

### Working on Challenges

1. **Read the challenge description** - Each challenge clearly lists what you need to build
2. **Look for TODO comments** - These guide you to where code needs to be added
3. **Check the hints section** - Helpful tips are provided at the bottom of each challenge
4. **Start small** - Implement one feature at a time
5. **Test frequently** - Make sure each feature works before moving to the next

### Example Challenge Structure

```typescript
const CounterChallenge: React.FC = () => {
  // TODO: Add your state here
  // const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="section">
      {/* Challenge description and requirements */}
      <div className="challenge">...</div>
      
      {/* Your implementation goes here */}
      <div style={{ padding: '20px', border: '2px dashed #ccc' }}>
        <h4>Your Implementation Goes Here</h4>
        {/* Add your components, buttons, inputs, etc. */}
      </div>
      
      {/* Helpful hints */}
      <div>
        <strong>Hints:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use useState for managing state</li>
          <li>Create separate functions for different actions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Happy Learning!** 🚀

Remember: The best way to learn programming is by doing. Don't just read the code - type it out, modify it, break it, and fix it. That's how you truly understand how things work.
